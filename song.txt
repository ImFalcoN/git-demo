Look in my eyes I'll make you see
We're drifting aimlessly
Blind in a world of make believe

Hear them sing their songs off key
And nod like they agree
Buying the need to be discreet

I've got no hand in matters worldly, I hardly care at all
What's going on fails to concern me, Cause I'm locked behind my wall
But you know what drives me out
Out of my mind

It's whatever makes you see, makes you believe
And forget about the premonition you need to conceive
The images they sell are illusion & dream
In other words dishonesty
