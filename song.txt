Look in my eyes I'll make you see
We're drifting aimlessly
Blind in a world of make believe

Hear them sing their songs off key
And nod like they agree
Buying the need to be discreet

I've got no hand in matters worldly, I hardly care at all
What's going on fails to concern me, Cause I'm locked behind my wall
But you know what drives me out
Out of my mind
